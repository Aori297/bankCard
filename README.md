# Bank Card Management System
This project is a Java-based application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and GUI development. It consists of two phases.



## Object-Oriented Design
In the first phase, the project implements a real-world scenario using Java's OOP approach. The core classes include:
- BankCard: Parent class representing a general bank card.
- DebitCard: Child class for managing debit card functionalities.
- CreditCard: Child class for managing credit card functionalities.

### Key Concepts:
- Conditional statements
- Constructors
- Method overriding
- Inheritance


## GUI Implementation
In the second phase, the project expands by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the BankCard, DebitCard, and CreditCard classes.

### Features:
- Insert and display card details
- Withdraw balance from the debit card
- Set and cancel credit limits on the credit card

### Key Concepts:
- Java GUI development using javax.swing and java.awt
- Event listeners and action events
